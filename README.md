# Flight Duration Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing flight duration data using Python. The main goal is to extract insights and prepare the data for further machine learning or visualization tasks.

## Features

- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key patterns and trends in the dataset.
- Applied **Feature Engineering** to extract meaningful columns like hours and minutes from raw duration data.
- Handled missing or inconsistent values to make the dataset clean and usable.
- Converted categorical data for better analysis and potential model compatibility.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for EDA)
